# Super Smash Memory Clicker

## How to Play
  The game starts when you first click on one of the cards spawned in the game window.
  As you click the cards will shuffle and redistribute themselves around the game window.
  Try to remember which ones have been clicked before, so that you don't click them twice in a row.
  
  ## Win Condition

  ## Lose Condition
You will lose if you click a card twice before clicking them all once.
